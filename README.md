# Bank Loan Case Study
Loan-providing companies find it difficult to provide loans to people with insufficient or non-existent credit history. Some customers take advantage of this by defaulting on their loans. In this scenario, you work for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various loans to urban customers. To ensure that applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected, you must use EDA to analyze the patterns present in the data.
When a company receives a loan application, it needs to make a decision on loan approval based on the applicant's profile. The bank's decision involves two types of risk:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, not providing the loan will result in a loss of business to the company.
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. is likely to default, approving the loan can lead to a financial loss for the company.
